# Question
Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer
HTMLCollections are lists of DOM **element** nodes that match specific traits (are buttons, are headers, are related to one another, etc). NodeLists are lists of individual elements in a DOM tree that aren't just element nodes. Nodelists include all kinds of nodes when returning information, such as any text or comments or attributes. While you can access information in both lists using the zero index method like arrays, they aren't arrays.
