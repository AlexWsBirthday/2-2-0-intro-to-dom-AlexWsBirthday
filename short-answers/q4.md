# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
use .innerHTML to fetch information mainly, and when you have a service installed to prevent users from injecting malicious code into your website. You want to use .createElement for faster run time, since it doesn't go through the whole process of parsing an HTML string and building a node tree out of it each time it runs. using .innerHTML will cause the hole browser to reparse and recreate all DOM nodes inside of the element targeted with .innerHTML until it's fully updated.
