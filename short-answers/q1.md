# Question
What is the DOM and what does it stand for?

# Answer
DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's the website laid out as an object structure, and allows programs (such as Javascript files) to access and change the way the document presents. The document object, for example, represents the whole website. You can create objects within the document object that represent the header, the home page welcome message, and the footer. The core DOM is a tree-like structure of nodes, while APIs add to the core DOM's abilities.
